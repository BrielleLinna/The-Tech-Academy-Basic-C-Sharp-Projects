# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This showcases various projects and assignments that utilize the C# programming language and the .NET framework.  Below are some of the more complex projects that showcases C# and .NET.

PROJECTS:
-Twenty One Game
-Car Insurance 
-Student Grade Code First
-Division


TWENTY ONE GAME:
This project is meant to showcase the popular casino game Twenty One or Black Jack.  In this program multiple classes were used including base and inheriting classes, as well as an abstract class. The base classes show how we can resuse methods and properties to save time in the future for the inheriting classes.   This uses various methods including a shuffle method which enables random output.  Also used in this project and enum and guid, and a variety of exception handlers to ensure the user is not cheating. The entire program is a great example of how we can use user input and create logic that will generate a random output.

CAR INSURANCE:
This project utlizes the MVC web application and is meant to resemble an insurance company's website. It allows for user input to be tracked inside a database.  It also introduces an admin feature for the employer to be able to easier see what customers and quotes have been generated.

STUDENT GRADE CODE FIRST:
This is the beginning stage of the code first approach in the entity framework.  It shows that by creating our classes and inputting in data, how the entity framework can create a database for us.  This database includes columns and tables with properties that correspond directly to the classes and properties we created inside the program.

DIVISION:
This is a great example of various methods that perform math operations.  The first method uses user input to then perform division and output that to the console.  The following method is a great example of how we can overload the method to display decimal output for more accuracy.  The next method is a static method, and the last method showcases using out parameters.  All of these play of vitual role in creating the most effective methods for our code based on the goal we are trying to accomplish.
